### 🔍 Question 1: Which product categories generate the most revenue across regions?

📊 **Summary of What the Data Shows:**
The *Women’s* category had the highest total revenue across all regions, followed by *Sports*. The *Men’s* category consistently generated the lowest revenue, peaking at just 1 million in the East region.

📌 **Key Insight or Interpretation:**

Despite having the same number of brands, the Women’s category offers more product types and achieves higher revenue with smaller average discounts. In contrast, the Men’s category offers fewer product types and relies more heavily on discounting. The Sports category, while featuring fewer brands, performs well across regions—likely due to deeper discounts and seasonal relevance.

💡 **Potential Action or Recommendation:** 

- Expand the Men’s product line to include more variety and test whether that boosts revenue in stronger-performing regions.
- Double down on the Sports category during peak seasons across regions, as discount-driven promotions seem effective for this segment.

### 🔍 Question 2: Which brands are selling the most units in each region?

📊 **Summary of What the Data Shows:**

WearHaus sold the most units across all regions. Kynetik and VoxaFit, both sports brands, ranked second and third respectively. All men-focused brands sold fewer than 80,000 units across all regions, whereas women-focused brands sold more than 200,000 units. This suggests that women-focused brands consistently outperform men-focused ones across regions.

📌 **Key Insight or Interpretation:**
Although WearHaus leads in total units sold due to its presence in all categories, it has the *lowest* unit sales within both the Men’s and Women’s categories. Interestingly, all sports brands appear in the top 5 for unit sales, which may point to a seasonal spike in sportswear demand. This theory gains some support from the fact that WearHaus ranks second for units sold in the Sports category.

💡 **Potential Action or Recommendation:** 

- WearHaus could explore launching a **“His and Hers”** capsule collection, allowing it to promote its Men’s and Women’s categories together without significant marketing spend.
- Men-focused brands may benefit from re-evaluating their heavy discounting strategy, as it’s not translating into higher unit sales. Instead, they could test smaller, targeted promotions or bundle deals to increase appeal.

### 🔍 Question 3: Are certain brands relying heavily on discounts?

📊 **Summary of What the Data Shows:**

Sports brands rely heavily on discounts, with Pulse9 offering an average discount rate of 23%. Despite this, Pulse9 did not rank among the top five revenue-generating brands. In contrast, Velvié — a women-focused brand — generated more revenue than Pulse9 while applying the lowest average discount (7%). WearHaus and UrbanForge fall in the mid-range with discount rates between 17%–19%, yet WearHaus leads in both units sold and revenue across all regions.

📌 **Key Insight or Interpretation:**

Velvié’s success, despite minimal discounting, appears tied to its category strategy and pricing power. As a women-focused brand — the top-selling category across regions — Velvié benefits from demand and maintains profitability. Its average price starts at $13.08, dropping only slightly to $12.40 after discounts.

In contrast, Pulse9 begins at $9.89 and drops to $7.78 post-discount, yet fails to reach the same revenue levels. This could support the theory that Pulse9 is using discounts to move old inventory after a sports season peak.

WearHaus, on the other hand, strikes a strong balance with solid pricing and wide category coverage, maintaining a competitive final price ($9.56) while leading in sales.

💡 **Potential Action or Recommendation:** 

- Pulse9 should consider reducing its reliance on heavy discounting, as it's not translating into higher revenue. Instead, they could experiment with smaller, targeted promotions, bundle deals, or inventory segmentation (e.g., only discounting off-season items).
- Velvié and similar premium-positioned brands could continue investing in brand equity and customer loyalty strategies, as their lower discounting hasn't hurt revenue.

### 🔍 Question 4: Are certain product types consistently priced higher than others?

📊 **Summary of What the Data Shows:**

Three of the highest-priced product types fall under the women’s category, with average prices ranging from $15 to $20 — dresses topping the list.

Velvié sells the most dresses, but interestingly, Loopline (a unisex brand) earns the highest revenue from them. Dresses consistently hold high price points across all regions. In the

**South**, dresses are priced lowest ($19.20) and generate the **least** revenue. In contrast, in the **East**, dresses have the highest price ($23.92) and bring in the **most** revenue — even though fewer units are sold.

📌 **Key Insight or Interpretation:**

Dresses are consistently priced higher than other product types and generate significant revenue, particularly in the East region. Despite selling fewer units, the East sees the highest dress revenue, likely due to higher price points and customer willingness to pay more. This may reflect regional demand patterns or cultural preferences for higher-end women’s fashion. Interestingly, although Velvié dominates dress sales volume, Loopline earns more revenue from dresses, possibly due to pricing strategy, marketing, or premium positioning.

💡 **Potential Action or Recommendation:** 

- Velvié could test premium pricing strategies for high-demand product types like dresses in the East region, where customers already accept higher prices.
- Loopline’s success with dresses suggests that product positioning, not just price, affects revenue — Velvié could explore what Loopline does differently (e.g., marketing, regional targeting, design) and adapt those tactics.
- Further analysis could explore customer profiles by region or survey data (if available) to understand *why* the East shows this purchasing pattern.

### 🔍 Question 5: What are the top revenue-generating products overall?

📊 **Summary of What the Data Shows:**

Overall, the top 10 revenue-generating products are dresses in the women’s category or sports items. In the men’s category, pants and outfit sets such as suits generate the most revenue. Most of the top-selling products are found in the East region, regardless of the category. Conversely, the South has less than 5 of the top-selling products in all categories.

📌 **Key Insight or Interpretation:**

A larger number of the top 10 and bottom 10 selling products are found in the East region. This may indicate that it is a larger populated area with customers of diverse income backgrounds.

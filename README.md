# FASHION SALES ANALYSIS || EXCEL

### PROJECT OVERVIEW

---

This project involved analyzing sales data for a fictional clothing company to uncover business insights and improve decision-making. Using Excel and Power BI, I performed data cleaning, transformation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and dashboard design. The goal was to extract meaningful insights about product performance, pricing, brand behavior, and customer trends across different regions.

### OBJECTIVE

---

- Clean and prepare raw sales data using Excel and Power Query.
- Analyze sales performance across brands, product categories, and regions.
- Identify trends in pricing, discounts, and product demand.
- Use EDA to develop business insights and recommendations.
- Build an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize KPIs and key findings.

### ABOUT THE DATA

---

I combined three separate datasets sourced from Kaggle, each representing fashion sales across men’s, women’s, and sports categories. The datasets were merged based on common attributes, with additional columns added to enhance analysis and support segmentation across categories and regions.

### CHAPTER 1: DATA CLEANING AND WRANGLING

---

Each dataset was cleaned individually using Excel and Power Query, before being consolidated into a single master file. I created a summary report for each dataset outlining:

- The initial structure and issues in the raw data
- The cleaning steps taken (e.g., handling missing values, formatting, renaming columns)
- Snapshots of the data before and after cleaning
- A summary of the cleaned dataset for quick reference

### CHAPTER 2: EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)

---

After familiarizing myself with the data, I formulated key business questions to guide the analysis. The goal was to uncover trends and relationships between variables, generate insights, and provide actionable recommendations to improve sales performance across regions and product categories.

I explored the data by:

- Comparing metrics like revenue, price, units sold, and discount rates
- Analyzing performance across regions, brands, and product types
- Interpreting patterns beyond surface-level numbers

The following questions shaped the analysis:

1. Which product categories generate the most revenue across regions?
2. Which brands are selling the most units in each region?
3. Are certain brands relying heavily on discounts?
4. Are certain product types consistently priced higher than others?
5. What are the top revenue-generating products overall?

### CHAPTER 3: KEY INSIGHTS

---

1. Price Elasticity
    - Sales volume drops sharply as product prices increase — with a 56% drop between the <$10 and $10–$20 range, and an 82% drop from $10–$20 to $20–$30, despite only moderate price increases.
    - Exception: Dresses remain high-revenue despite higher price, suggesting inelastic demand— potentially due to fashion appeal, brand positioning, or regional/cultural preferences.
2. Product Categories
    - The women’s category drives the most revenue across all regions, largely due to a wider variety of product types
    - In contrast, men’s clothing has fewer product types, which limits its overall revenue potential.
3. Discounts
    - Brands offering deep discounts (e.g., Pulse9) don’t consistently rank high in revenue.
    - This may indicate low discount sensitivity or limited brand loyalty, where customers aren't swayed by price reductions alone
4. Brands
    - Brands with diverse product offering**s** (e.g., WearHaus, which spans women’s, men’s, and sports categories) outperform those focused on a single category.
    - Multi-category brands benefit from broader market reach and more consistent sales across regions.

### CHAPTER 4: RECOMMENDATIONS

---

- Men-focused brands may benefit from re-evaluating their heavy discounting strategy, as it’s not translating into higher unit sales. Instead, they could test smaller, targeted promotions or bundle deals to increase appeal.
- Double down on the Sports category during peak seasons across regions, as discount-driven promotions seem effective for this segment.
- Pulse9 should consider reducing its reliance on heavy discounting, as it's not translating into higher revenue. Instead, they could experiment with smaller, targeted promotions, bundle deals, or inventory segmentation (e.g., only discounting off-season items).
- Velvié could test premium pricing strategies for high-demand product types like dresses in the East region, where customers already accept higher prices. Loopline’s success with dresses suggests that product positioning, not just price, affects revenue — Velvié could explore what Loopline does differently (e.g., marketing, regional targeting, design) and adapt those tactics. Further analysis could explore customer profiles by region or survey data (if available) to understand *why* the East shows this purchasing pattern.

### CHAPTER 5: DASHBOARD

### CHAPTER 6: REFLECTIONS

---

- I learned how to follow proper data wrangling guidelines, which made my cleaning process more structured and reliable.
- I explored Power Query functions and learned how to dynamically populate table cells, making my data models more flexible and automated.
- Most importantly, I realized that Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) isn’t just about visualizing the numbers — it’s about digging deeper to understand *why* the numbers look the way they do. Patterns often reflect real-world factors like consumer behavior, product strategies, or seasonality.

### SUMMARY

---

This project explored fashion sales data across multiple categories and regions. Key insights revealed that women’s products dominate revenue, some high-priced items like dresses perform well despite price sensitivity, and discounts don’t always lead to higher sales. Overall, this analysis improved my ability to clean, analyze, and interpret data to support business decisions.
